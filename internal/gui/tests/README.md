# Dropdown browser regression

`menu-scroll.test.cjs` loads the real HTML, CSS and JavaScript with isolated API
fixtures. It checks session folder/model filters and the main model picker in
Chromium and WebKit, including wheel, scrollbar track/thumb, keyboard selection
and dismissal. It does not start the backend or read local user configuration.

`click-scroll.test.cjs` holds the rule that a click never moves the page
(see "where the reader is" in `app.js`): on the Routing page, Live and a day
picked in turn with the list scrolled to its end; a click whose handler sets
scrollTop, grows the page above, redraws itself, or scrolls from a timer or a
shared helper; a control under what it unrolls (`data-unrolls`) going down
with it; a click that asks to go somewhere with `scrollOnPurpose(e)`;
the room kept at the foot going as the reader scrolls back; and the wheel.

`panel-fold.test.cjs` expands and collapses on the Agents page with the list
scrolled to its end, in the tray panel (one agent open) and in the window:
"Show {n} more" unrolls the rest under the button, the view going down with
them and never back up; "Show less", and a row opened and closed, leave what
was clicked where it is on every frame.

`gateway-fold.test.cjs` folds Connect on the Gateway page with the view
scrolled: its fields hide, the head keeps the base URL and a copy button, the
head stays where it was, and the fold is remembered across a reload.

`routing-kind.test.cjs` lists calls Codex makes for itself (a guardian review,
a title, memories, a turn on Luna Reserve, a kind it does not know yet): each
has a grey tag by its model in the Requests list, in English and Chinese, the
model keeping its room first, and the request's story says what it was.

`balance-fix.test.cjs` opens a custom provider whose balance token sits
beside new-api's `/api/usage/token` (and a new one with a token and no
Balance URL): the editor says so, one click moves it to `/api/user/self`
with the quota as its field, the New-Api-User header is asked for until it
is typed, Check balance asks as the form has it and says the fix plainly,
and the Usage page's card does too.

`cli-update.test.cjs` draws the agents' CLI versions on the Agents page
(#202) from a faked API: the version after each name, "Update to x.y.z" only
where magpie knows how the CLI was installed, the rows' height kept, an
update clicked with the view scrolled (busy, then the new version, the page
left where it was), a failed one giving its reason and the pill back, and
the words in Chinese. Nothing is installed.

`panel-profiles.test.cjs` saves a profile in the tray panel with the list
scrolled to its end: "＋ Save current" opens the name field beside it, the
list not moving, field and button in sight, one focus ring; the button then
reads Save and a click on it saves, as Enter does; an empty name keeps the
field; Escape closes it; in English and Chinese.

`login-import.test.cjs` brings ChatGPT accounts in from CLIProxyAPI's auth
files: offered from the accounts list and from a browser sign-in under way,
the box says the refresh spends the file's sign-in, what is pasted is posted
as it is, and each account's outcome is listed, in English and Chinese.

With Node.js and Playwright available:

```sh
node --test internal/gui/tests/menu-scroll.test.cjs internal/gui/tests/click-scroll.test.cjs internal/gui/tests/panel-fold.test.cjs internal/gui/tests/gateway-fold.test.cjs internal/gui/tests/routing-kind.test.cjs internal/gui/tests/balance-fix.test.cjs internal/gui/tests/cli-update.test.cjs internal/gui/tests/login-import.test.cjs
```

If Playwright is installed outside the repository, set `NODE_PATH` to the
directory containing its package. The suite uses Playwright's Chromium and
WebKit binaries (`playwright install chromium webkit`). No frontend dependency
is needed by the app itself. Tested with Playwright 1.63.0.

Set `BROWSER=chromium` or `BROWSER=webkit` for one engine. Set `ARTIFACT_DIR` to
an external directory to retain screenshots and Playwright traces, including
failed assertions. These browser checks run separately from `make test`.
